            The Internet is a technical infrastructure that allows billions of computers to be connected all together. But how is it possible that all of these computers from around the world can connect to each other. In this blog posting I will attempt to explain how the internet works.
          </p>
          <p>
          Lets first start by looking at a users view of using the internet. We sit down at our computer. We connect to the wi-fi or plug in an Ethernet cable into our computer. Once we are connected we type in a website address and we surf on. That is all that most of us know.
          </p>
          <p>
          The first step of connecting to the internet is connecting your computer a modem. The modem is usually connected to cable or telephone infrastructure because it&#39;s something that most people have in their homes or businesses all around the world. The modem turns the information from our network or computer into information manageable by the telephone infrastructure and vice versa.
          </p>
          <p>
          The modem connects our computers to an Internet Service Provider(ISP).  An ISP is a company that manages some special routers that link all together and can also access other ISPs' routers. So the message from our network is carried through the network of ISP networks to the destination network.
          </p>
          <p>
          Now that we&#39;re connected to the ISP we can now reach out to other computers and networks. All computer linked to a network has a unique address to identify it. This address is called a Internet Protocol or IP. It is an address made of a series of four numbers separated by dots.
          </p>
          <p>
          To make things similar for humans we can alias an IP address with a human readable name called a domain name. A domain name lets us replace the IP address made up of numbers and dots into easily readable like yahoo.com or google.com. That&#39;s a lot easier than reading or typing in 123.122.2.45. </p>
          <p>
          So once you type in the domain name you will be directed to your desired website. The first step starts at home. You need a computer or some type of device that is able to connect to a modem via wi-fi or Ethernet plug. The next step is actually connecting to the modem. Once you&#39;ve connected to the modem, the modem has to reach out an Internet Service Provider. From there you type in a Internet Protocol or a domain name and from there you&#39;re directed to a website. This is all made possible by the connections explained above.

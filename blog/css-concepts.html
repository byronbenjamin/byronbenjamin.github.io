            What is the difference between margin, border, and padding? In this blog post I will explain the difference between the 3 and how they are used.
          </p>

          <p>
            The margin controls the space between the outside of a element and another element.
            The border simply borders a element. It is located between the margin and the padding. When you see solid lines or dashed lines surrounding text on a web page it is usually the border. Padding is the space between the content (words, numbers, pictures, etc) and the border.
          </p>
          <p>
            To better understand take a look a the picture below.
          </p>

            <img src="/imgs/mpb.gif"/>

          <p>
            From the picture you can see that the content is surrounded by the padding. It is the space between the content and the border. The border surrounds the content and padding. It is the space between the margin and border. The margin surrounds everything and controls the space between that element or content and surrounding elements.
          </p>

          <p>
            You can set the border, padding, and margins however you like. You have total control. If you take another look at the picture above you see that there is a top, right, bottom, and left. You can set the margin, border, and padding however you want in each of those directions. They dont have to be equivalent on all sides if you don't want them to be.
          </p>

          <p>
            To set the margin, border, or padding you can add in the following spaces marked by a X.
          </p>
          <p>
            padding: X ; <br>
            border: X ; <br>
            margin: X ; <br>
          </p>
          <p>
            The above example will set the padding, border, or margin, in all four directions, to whatever number you place in place of the X. They don't have to be stacked the way that they are in the example. You can do one or all if you like.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can also set the padding, border, or margin in different directions. It'll look similiar to the code from above.
          </p>
          <p>
            padding: X X X X ; <br>
            border: X X X X; <br>
            margin: X X X X; <br>
          </p>
          <p>
            In the above example you control each side starting clockwise from the top and working your way around. So the first positon is the top, the second is the right, the third is for the bottom, and the fourth is for the left.
          </p>
          <p>This was a brief explanation of the differences between padding, border, and margin and how to set them. This week I used these alot to complete my assignments. It was a little nerve wrecking at times but it was fun and I enjoyed the challenge.

            So this is my first week of Dev Bootcamp Phase 0. It has been an interesting week. I learned how to use the command line. I learned a lot of new things like what is version control and it's person. I learned what git was. I learned how to send files to GitHub using the terminal.
          </p>

          <p>
            Most of this week focused on version control. I learned that version control is very important in this field. Version control keeps track of the changes you make to a file. In a article that I read, it compared version control to a checkpoint in a video game. So it allows you to go back to a certain point in time and make any changes you need to.
          </p>

          <p>
            We learned about git. Git is a version control system that stores each save or commit as a snapshot of your work. Each time you make a save or commit you can go back to either one and make changes. During this course we use GitHub. GitHub is a way of storing our files and changes online in a sort of social media setting. GitHub allows us to share our code and projects with co-workers and the public. If needed they can make changes and commit them without everyone being in the same location.
          </p>

          <p>
            Overall this has been an informative week. I was new to most of the information given to us. I never thought I would get through all of the different videos and articles on version control. Furthermore I never thought I would fully understand how to commit to GitHub using just the terminal. There are so many steps that have to be taken. But i was able to. I know understand it alot more than I did at the start of the week. I'm excited to continue learning and completing all of the challenges of DBC.

    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi all, My name is Byron Gage. I was born in Oklahoma and was raised in Chicago. I've spent most of my life in Chicago. I attended highschool at Gordon Technical High School. From there I attended the University of Illinois at Chicago. Initially I started as an architecture major but lost interest. I switched majors and earned a bachelors degree in criminal justice. In January 2015 I started my journey as a programmer. I took a javascript class at Harvard through its extension program. I was great and helped me to gain more interest in that field.</p>

    <p>
      My interests are sports, traveling, and watching good movies. I support each and every Chicago sports team. My favorite sports are Basketball and Football. I enjoy watching our teams play but I enjoy playing these sports even more. I love to travel and hope to travel more. My 2 most exciting trips were South Korea and Nairobi, Kenya.

      I developed my interest in coding as a yound child. Playing video games and doing things on the computer, I always wondered how these things worked and what made them work. I didn't have the resources at the time to further my interest in them, so I didn't pursuit much further. I met a friend who was in the web develop field. She introduced me to coding. We took the javascript class together. That rekindled my interest in programming.

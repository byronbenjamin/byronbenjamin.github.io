    How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

    It was easy. We first discussed how we wanted the wireframe to look and then we brought those ideas to paper using the web app Mockingbird.

    Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

    Yes I did. It's similiar to brainstorming before you type a paper. Wireframing allowed us to draft how we wanted our blog page to look before typing the html code.

    What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

    We decided that a good wireframe contained the elements that you want on your finished page. That includes text areas, links, headings, and photos.

    What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

    I did not learn any new semantic elements in this lesson.

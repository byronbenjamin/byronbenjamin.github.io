**What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?**

I learned what each one is in control of. I learned that the padding properties set the size of the white space between the element content and the element border. I learned that border properties set borders around the element and that it is located between the padding and the margin. I learned that the margin is used to create space around the element.


**What did you learn about CSS positioning?**

I learned that its not as easy as you think. You have to know what and understand the width and heights and padding and margins of elements in order to successfully place your elements where you want.

**What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?**

The easiest aspect of my design that I found easiest was the working with the font and sizes. The most difficult was placing elements where I needed them to be and also placing my unordered list where I wanted them.

**What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?**

I learned that it takes time. It's all about trial and error. It good to use the developer tools and work with different elements before making the changes in you html or CSS code.
